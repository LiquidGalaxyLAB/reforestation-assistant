# Reforestation Assistant & Simulator

The Reforestation Assistant & Simulator idea is to create an app to help on reforestation of degraded areas of the planet by drone or manually. The project will consist of an Android App where users can plan the reforesting missions, by defining areas of seeding, specific seed/tree location, drone landing points, fly zones and other helpful metrics. All the gathered information will be dynamically displayed on the Liquid Galaxy cluster using KMLs and also on the app with the help of graphics and text to bring users a great and immersive overview of the mission panorama.

This is being started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project with the Liquid Galaxy Organization alongside the Dronecoria team.
